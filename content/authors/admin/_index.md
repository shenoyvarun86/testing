      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science and International Relations at the University of Southern California. Previously, I was the inaugural Gerhard Casper Postdoctoral Fellow in Rule of Law at the Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law in Stanford University.  I obtained my PhD in political science at the University of Rochester in 2022

My primary research interest lies in the political economy of development. I use an institutional lens and a wide range of methods to analyze  the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to   bias and discrimination. Specifically, I study topics such as the judiciary, women in politics, political representation, political parties, and bureaucracies in the developing world, with a regional focus on South Asia. 

<!--- I am also exploring questions surrounding misinformation, disinformation, and technological innovations that have the potential to reshape the way we perceive political institutions.My work has appeared (or is forthcoming) in the _American Journal of Political Science,  The Quarterly Journal of Political Science, and Comparative Political Studies_.
